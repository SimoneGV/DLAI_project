# Lossy Text Compression  
This repository contains a Python-based implementation for lossy text compression. 

The notebook explores techniques for reducing the size of text data while retaining its semantic meaning.

To test the project:

	- Open the jupyter file "main_lossy_text_compression.ipynb".
 
 	- Follow the instructions in the file to test the model.
  
  	- Is possible to insert custom texts to test the capabilities of the model.
